    <h2>MEN'S WERE</h2>
    <P>Men's Wear is a 1953 painting by Australian artist John Brack. The painting depicts the interior of a menswear store, including the proprietor and some mannequins, standing in front of displays of ties and trousers. A mirror in the background reflects a silhouette of the artist.[1]

        It seems to be a simple image of an ordinary shop, but its simplicity is deceptive. There’s a complex interaction of lines of sight, for a start; and the jokey inclusion of the silhouetted figure opens up the interior space to the space outside the shop, outside the pictorial space even. And there’s a play - inspired, perhaps, by Magritte - between man, mannequin and silhouette that creates ambiguity. It’s a sort of surrealism of the high street.

    Indian clothing has evolved over the years. The influence of different empires and kingdoms, the emergence of Islam, and later, the British colonization of India had a significant impact on the attire of people. Following Independence, fashion in India became a major phenomenon. Indian designers have mastered the craft of embroidery and combined traditional and modern clothing to create standout designs. The Indian women’s apparel market was the sixth largest women’s apparel market in the world in 2020. In the domestic market, sales for women’s fashion amounted to over one billion Indian rupees in 2021.
